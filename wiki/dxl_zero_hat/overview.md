Dynamixel X Zero Shield is a companion daughter board for Raspberry Pi single board computers. It provides all in one solution for powering and communicating with Dynamixel robotic actuators.

Offers plug and play solution, only a single power cable is required for both the shield and the computer. Accommodates efficient 3A voltage regulator for powering the Raspberry Pi with over voltage transient and over current protection. Includes capacitor for short burst current consumption compensation.

Supports both RS485 and TTL communication protocols. Contains LED indicators for quick and easy hardware status signaling and a reset switch.
